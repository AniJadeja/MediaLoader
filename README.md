# MediaLoader

This is a demo app to show or load media from external memory.

There is a Uri which can be used to change the media type which we want to load.

 `uri = MediaStore.Video.Media.EXTERNAL_CONTENT_URI;`
 
 changing this single line allows us to switch to Images,Audio or Video respectively.
 
 `uri = MediaStore.Images.Media.EXTERNAL_CONTENT_URI;`
 
 `uri = MediaStore.Audio.Media.EXTERNAL_CONTENT_URI;`
 
 `uri = MediaStore.Video.Media.EXTERNAL_CONTENT_URI;`
